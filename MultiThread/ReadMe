This program will create a multithreaded program that takes one or more numeric arguments from the command line and displays the 
prime factors (links to an external site) of each number. Each child thread will be passed a number from the parent thread that 
should be factored by that thread. Each number should be factored by a different thread. Each child thread will return a sorted 
integer array of prime factors for that number. The parent thread will wait for each thread to terminate. The parent thread will
display the original number provided and all factors returned by the child thread to the console.

All threads should be created before any are joined. The reason for using multiple threads in a program like this is so that 
calculations can be faster if there is more than one processor or core.

The child thread must not display any data. Your only output should be provided by the main thread, and only after waiting 
for the thread to complete.
