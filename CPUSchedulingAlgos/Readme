This program will read a list of process start times and durations from stdin. That list will be used 
four times to run through the following CPU scheduling algorithms: 
• First Come, First Served 
• Shortest Job First 
• Shortest Remaining Time First 
• Round Robin 
It will show three statistics: the average process response time, the average process wait time, 
and the average process turnaround time for each scheduling algorithm. The time quantum for the 
Round Robin scheduler is 100ms. Your program only needs to work with a maximum of 25 processes.
